# Password Generator

Summary:
=======================================================================
A C# Windows application that generates a password using letters, numbers and/or symbols.

How to Use:
=======================================================================
Select the length you want the password to be, check what types of characters you want to use, e.g. Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers and Symbols, and click the 'Generate Password' button.

If you like the password, just click the 'Copy' button beside the generated password, and it will copy the text to your clipboard, ready to paste into any password field.

If would like to remember it, click the 'Save Password' button. This saves the password as a '.pass' file.

If you already have a password saved on your PC, click the 'Open Password' button and this will open up the Windows Explorer prompt and will search for a '.pass' file in the directory. When you find the file you're looking for, open it and it will appear inside the application.
